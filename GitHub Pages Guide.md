# **Step-by-Step Guide: Hosting on GitHub Pages**  

GitHub Pages is a free and easy way to host your emergency medical profile online. Follow these simple steps to publish your project.

## **1️⃣ Fork or Download the Repository**  
If you haven’t already:  
- Click the **Fork** button on the top right of [this repository](https://github.com/gsrntvc2102000/open-emergency-medical-profile) to create your own copy.  
OR  
- Download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to your computer.

## **2️⃣ Rename the Repository (Optional but Recommended)**  
To make your profile URL look clean, rename your repository to something like:  
```
my-medical-profile
```
You can rename it by going to **Settings > Repository name**.

## **3️⃣ Enable GitHub Pages**  
1. Go to your repository settings (**Settings** tab).  
2. Scroll down to **Pages**.  
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.  
4. Choose **main** as the branch and select **root** as the folder.  
5. Click **Save**.  

## **4️⃣ Wait for Deployment**  
GitHub will now deploy your site. This may take a few minutes.  
Once done, you will see a link like:  
```
https://yourusername.github.io/my-medical-profile/
```
(This is your personal emergency profile URL.)  

## **5️⃣ Edit Your Profile Details**  
- Open `index.html` in a code editor or GitHub’s online editor.  
- Replace the sample details with your actual medical information.  
- Save and commit your changes.  

## **6️⃣ (Optional) Generate a QR Code**  
- Use any free QR code generator online.  
- Paste your GitHub Pages URL.  
- Print or save the QR code for easy access.
