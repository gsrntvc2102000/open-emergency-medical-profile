|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Free Hosting    | ✅      | ✅     |

🚀 **Use Netlify if you prefer drag-and-drop deployment.**  
🔥 **Use Vercel if you want automatic updates when editing your GitHub repository.**  

Let me know if you need any modifications! 😊! Both **Netlify** and **Vercel** allow you to use **custom domains for free**. Here's how it works:  

### ✅ **Free Custom Domains**  
- You can connect a **yourname.netlify.app** or **yourname.vercel.app** subdomain for free.  
- You can also use your **own domain** (like `yourname.com`), but you need to **buy the domain separately** from registrars like Namecheap, Google Domains, or GoDaddy.  

### 💰 **Paid Features (Optional)**  
- If you want **custom SSL settings**, **team collaboration**, or **advanced analytics**, then you might need a **paid plan**.  
- But for basic custom domains, **Netlify and Vercel offer it for free**!  

So, if you already own a domain, you can **connect it without paying extra** to Netlify or Vercel. 😊
