# **📌 Step-by-Step Guide: Hosting on AWS S3**  

## **1️⃣ Create an AWS Account (If You Don’t Have One)**  
🔹 Go to **[AWS Sign Up](https://aws.amazon.com/)** and create an account.  
🔹 You’ll need a **valid email & phone number** for verification.  
🔹 AWS **Free Tier** is available for new users (S3 hosting is free within limits).  

---

## **2️⃣ Create an S3 Bucket**  
S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a storage service that lets you host static websites.  

🔹 Go to **AWS Console** → **S3**  
🔹 Click **"Create bucket"**  

### **Enter These Details:**  
1. **Bucket Name** → *(Example: my-medical-profile)* *(Choose a unique name, e.g., yourname-medical-profile)*  
2. **Region** → *(Choose a region close to you, e.g., "US East (N. Virginia)" or "Asia Pacific (Mumbai)")*  
3. **Block Public Access Settings**  
   - ❌ **Uncheck** "Block all public access" *(needed for website access)*  
   - ✅ Check "I acknowledge that the bucket will be public"  
4. Click **"Create bucket"** 🎉

## **3️⃣ Upload Website Files**  
Now, let’s upload the **Open Emergency Medical Profile** files.  

🔹 Go to your **S3 bucket** → Click **"Upload"**  
🔹 Click **"Add files"** & select all your project files *(HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)*  
🔹 Click **"Upload"**  

---

## **4️⃣ Enable Static Website Hosting**  
Now, we configure the bucket to act as a **public website**.  

🔹 In your bucket, go to **"Properties"**  
🔹 Scroll down to **"Static website hosting"**  
🔹 Click **"Edit"** → Select **"Enable"**  
🔹 Enter the following:  
   - **Index document** → `index.html` *(Your homepage file)*  
   - **Error document** → `index.html` *(Optional: fallback page)*  
🔹 Click **"Save changes"**  

📌 **Now, your S3 bucket is ready to serve web pages!**

## **5️⃣ Set Permissions for Public Access**  
To allow anyone to access your profile page:  

🔹 Go to **"Permissions"** tab → Scroll down to **"Bucket policy"**  
🔹 Click **"Edit"** → Copy-Paste this policy:  

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
🔹 Replace **your-bucket-name** with your actual bucket name  
🔹 Click **"Save changes"**  

---

## **6️⃣ Get Your Website URL**  
🔹 Go to **"Properties"** → Scroll to **"Static website hosting"**  
🔹 You’ll see a URL like this:  
   ```
   http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com
   ```  
🔹 **Copy this link** → Your medical profile is now **LIVE!** 🎉  

---

## **7️⃣ (Optional) Use a Custom Domain**  
If you want a custom domain like `myprofile.com`:  
🔹 Buy a domain from **AWS Route 53**, **GoDaddy**, or **Namecheap**  
🔹 Create an **Amazon CloudFront distribution** for secure access  
🔹 Point your domain to the S3 bucket  

*(This step is optional, but improves security & branding!)*  

---

## **8️⃣ Secure Your Data (Optional)**  
If you don’t want your medical info to be public:  
🔹 Instead of making the bucket public, keep it private  
🔹 **Share a private link** only with people who need access  
🔹 Use **encryption tools** to protect sensitive info
